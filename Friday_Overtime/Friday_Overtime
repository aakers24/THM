## Friday Overtime

Tags: Blue Team, CTI, Defense, OSINT

Tools: Linux Archive Manager, Google, Cyberchef

Process:

* The first question was answered in the ticket.

* After extracting the files from the archive using the built-in Linux File System Archive Manager, using the `sha1sum` command on the file will yield the answer to the next question.

* The rest of the questions I answered by just googling for the right things.

    * The name of the framework is present without even moving the page when you google for all of the names of the files together.

    * One of the results on the first page has the Mitre Att&ck Technique number for the file.

    * It also has the URL and throwing that into cyberchef to defand it gives this answer.

    * This page also has the IP address and when it is thrown into cyberchef it gives the next answer.

    * Putting the IP from the previous answer into VirusTotal gives a result that targetted androids on the date provided. Clicking on that entry, the sha1 hash is present on the page.
