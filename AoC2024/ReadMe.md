## My notes on the 2024 Advent of Cyber event (and Side Quest) put on by <a href="https://tryhackme.com/room/adventofcyber2024">TryHackMe.com</a>!

I do not intend to take full notes this year as in the past it has increased the time it takes for me to complete the tasks each day and I am busier this year than in the previous years. I also am going to attempt the Side Quest, but may not follow it through to the end for similar reasons.

Merry Christmas!
